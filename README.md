# Hot-Potato-game
Players are arranged in a circle. The potato begins with one of the players. While music plays, the hot potato is passed from player to player, around the circle. Whoever is holding the potato when the music stops is out. The potato is handed to the next person, and the music starts up again. The game continues until only one player remains. That player is the winner.
